This placeholder folder is referenced in the [data_preparation_credbank_part2](https://github.com/hawkek/disaster_rumors/tree/main/code/data_preparation_credbank_part2.ipynb) and, upon running the code within, will contain CSV files for each topic included in our final data set.
There will be 224 files, each containing tweets belonging to each topic, as described by the attributes "tweet_id", "user_id", "create_time", "topic_key", and "is_credible".
There will be 13,799,503 tweets represented in these CSV files, which need to be combined, and then you can use their IDs to extract the text content using Twitter's API.
